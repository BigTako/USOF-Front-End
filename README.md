### What is it? | [Door Is DEMO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5is4CUX0wAM&ab_channel=AbibSosay)

**Door Is** - web application (forum-style platform) built with React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL (using Sequelize). It provides a space where users can engage in discussions by asking questions and providing answers.

The application's frontend is built with React, that allows for a dynamic and responsive user experience. The backend is built with Node.js, it handles all the server-side logic, including user authentication, data validation, and request handling.

The data is stored in a PostgreSQL database, a powerful, open-source object-relational database system. Sequelize, a promise-based Node.js ORM, is used for tasks such as data modeling, data validation, and database migrations.

Overall, this application provides a platform for users to share knowledge, engage in discussions, and learn from each other, all within a user-friendly and interactive environment.
