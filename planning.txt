28s pizzeria

1) Project requirements from the business
    -Very simple pizzaria app where users can order one or multiple pizza from menu
    -No API is provided so need to implement it by myself
    -At home page app should ask user for name, if name is admin - ask for password also
    -Requires two roles user and admin
    -User should have an oppurtunity to save ordered pizzas to the cart, so to be able to make only one order with all the pizzas
    -if it possible GPS location could also be provided in order to make client life a little bit easier
    -Each order must have a unique ID , so the user can track it's status
